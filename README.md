# Sonic Pi Scheme of Work
[Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net) is an open source programming environment developed by Dr Sam Aaron, designed to explore and teach programming concepts through the process of creating new sounds. This is a scheme of work which emphasises the importance of creativity in the learning process and gives users the control to turn their sonic ideas into reality.

## Updates
Sonic Pi has gone through many changes and updates since the original repo (which can still be found from where this was forked or on the original-fork branch) and this is where we'll update the lessons and hopefully scaffold for different age groups.

This has been updated to work with any computer, not just Raspberry Pis.

## Students will learn:

Over the course of six lessons, students will learn:

- What a Raspberry Pi is, what its main features are, and how to set up and use one
- How to write text-based code to produce a music track
- Computer Science concepts:
	- Sequencing
	- Debugging
	- Iteration
	- Conditionals
	- Data Structures
	- Algorithms
	- Functions
	- Concurrency
